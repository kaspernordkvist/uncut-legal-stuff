# Privacy and Terms

So, even though UNCUT.wtf is a one-man band, when it says “we,” “our,” “us,” or “website” on this page, we are referring to UNCUT.wtf. It just sounds a bit more official, don’t you think?

When we say “you” or “your,” we are referring to… well, you — and the other wonderful people who visit this website.

The below “Privacy Policy” and “Terms of Use” may change from time to time and any changes will be reflected on this page. If the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. All changes made to this page are tracked [on Github](https://github.com/kaspernordkvist/uncut_legal_stuff).

If you have any questions or concerns about the content of this page, please send an <span class="js-copyEmail">email</span>. There’s no legal team but we’ll do our best to answer.
